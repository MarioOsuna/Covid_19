    <string name="texto">Protect yourself and those around you by informing yourself and taking appropriate precautions. Follow the advice of your local public health agency. To prevent the spread of COVID-19: Wash your hands often. Use soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Keep a safe distance from anyone who coughs or sneezes. Do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. When you cough or sneeze, cover your nose and mouth with your elbow flexed or with a tissue. Stay home if you feel bad. If you have a fever, cough, and shortness of breath, seek medical attention. Call ahead. Follow the instructions of your local health agency. Avoiding unnecessary visits to healthcare facilities enables healthcare systems to function more effectively, resulting in your protection and that of others.</string>
